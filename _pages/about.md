I'm Professor of Software Verification in the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary, University of London. Previously I was a Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellow. 

I was also a founder of Monoidics Ltd a technology startup specialised in automatic verification tools.
Monoidics was acquired by Facebook in July 2013.

I received my PhD from the University of Twente, in The Netherlands.

I'm currently on leave at Meta where I'm working on Developer Tooling and Infrastructure for WhatsApp.
