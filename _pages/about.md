I'm Professor of Software Verification in the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary, University of London. Previously I was a Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellow. 

I was also a founder of Monoidics Ltd a technology startup specialised in automatic verification tools.
Monoidics was acquired by Facebook in July 2013.

I'm the recipient of several awards, including **The Roger Needham Award 2012**, the **Royal Academy of Engineering Silver Medal 2014**, the **IEEE Computer Society Cybersecurity Award For Practice 2021**, the **ACM SIGPLAN POPL 2019 Most Influential Paper Award**, the **SIGPLAN Most influential OOPSLA paper award 2018**, the **CAV Award 2016**.

I'm currently on leave at Anthropic where I'm doing research on connections between LLM and program verifications and analysis.

I received my PhD from the University of Twente, in The Netherlands.
