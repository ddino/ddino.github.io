Awards
======
* **IEEE Computer Society Cybersecurity Award For Practice 2021.** The IEEE Computer Society Cybersecurity Award for Practice is intended to recognize individuals and small teams who are generating transformative cybersecurity capabilities that have been realized.  
* **ACM SIGPLAN POPL 2019 Most Influential Paper Award.** Presented annually to the author(s) of a paper presented at the POPL held 10 years prior to the award year. The papers are judged by their influence over the past decade.
* **SIGPLAN Most influential OOPSLA paper award 2018.** Presented annually to the author(s) of a paper presented at the OOPSLA held 10 years prior to the award year. The papers are judged by their influence over the past decade.
* **CAV Award 2016.** The CAV award is given annually at the CAV conference for fundamental contributions to the field of Computer-Aided Verification.
* **Royal Academy of Engineering Silver Medal 2014.** The Royal Academy of Engineering Silver Medal recognises outstanding contribution to UK engineering, that also results in successful market exploitation.
* **Roger Needham Award, 2012.** The Roger Needham Award is made annually by the British Computer Society for a distinguished research contribution in computer science by a UK based researcher within ten years of their PhD. 

Software Tools 
======
* **INFER (2009-2013)** Initially a commercial verification tool for memory safety of C. Industrial users includes Airbus, ARM, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Lawrence Livermore National Labo- ratory. Currently INFER is open source and it's being developed mainly inside Meta.
* **Abductor (2008-2010).** Highly-scalable program analysis tool proving memory safety for program manipulating heaps. The first tool performing deep-heap analysis able to scale to millions of line of code. 
* **Space Invader (2005-2008).** Program analysis tool proving safety properties for pro- grams manipulating heaps. Space Invader was the first automatic tool able to verify the use of pointer structures in entire industrial programs (Microsoft and Linux device drivers up to 10K LOC). Released on BSD license in 2008.
* **jStar (2008).** Program Verification tool for Java programs. The first automatic verification tool able to verify programs extensively used by developers in real-world Java applications. 
* **Mutant (2006)** Program analysis tool proving termination of program manipulating heaps. In collaboration with Microsoft Research (Cambridge).
